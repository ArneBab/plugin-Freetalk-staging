name: CI cronjobs

# FIXME: Add these cronjobs:
# - Weekly CI run on branches next and master
# - Daily CI run on branch master IF branch next of fred changed.
# FIXME: GHA runs cronjobs on the default branch only. But we should run these both on branches next
# and master.

    # cronjob also runs on Freenet's GitHub repo and fred developers thus get an email if their
    # changes break Freetalk.
    # NOTICE: I think GHA currently disables cronjobs if a repo did not have changes for 60 days,
    # check if that is true. Then it may be necessary to move the cronjob to the fred repo because
    # the Freetalk repo on Freenet's GitHub is not that frequently updated.
