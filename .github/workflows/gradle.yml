# FIXME: This currently is the old Travis CI script, NOT a GitHub Actions script!
# It has been moved to the GitHub Actions path to preserve git history when converting it to a GHA
# script. So convert it to the GHA syntax and then remove this FIXME.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle

# TODO: Can likely be removed, doesn't seem to change anything.
